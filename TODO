0.8 TODO:
- Keys per location
- Tunnels per location
- Only add keys from keychain event if keychain holds keys
- Admin wrapper for tunnel ports < 1024
- Allow remote connections to a local tunneled port (Sep 28 - Kevin Ballard - SSHKeychain modifications)
- Option for screensaver check interval
- Option to unload keys after a period of time
- The option to not display messages regarding tunnels (Nov 05 - Marc Liyanage  - Feature suggestion for SSHKeychain)
- Listen to local forwarded ports and start up the tunnel on demand (that's going to require some hacking with random ports
  to have ssh listening on)

1.0 TODO:
- Comment & Clean up
- Implement Exceptions instead of NSLog
- Package

The Early Spring Code Cleanup:

- [[[[foo alloc] init] autorelease] retain] is rubbish.
- #define NSStrings is rubbish
- Constants should start uppercase
- Check retain/release
- Implement dealloc for all classes containing iVars
- NULL -> nil
- Use objectEnumerator for arrays, instead of indexes
- Check task arguments (@"-arg", @"foo", instead of @"-arg foo")
- Check for repeating code
- Move local() to a macro (http://developer.apple.com/intl/localization/tools.html)
