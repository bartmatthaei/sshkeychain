0.8 TODO:
- Keys per location
- Tunnels per location
- Only add keys from keychain event if keychain holds keys
- Admin wrapper for tunnel ports < 1024
- Option for screensaver check interval
- Option to unload keys after a period of time
- The option to not display messages regarding tunnels (Nov 05 - Marc Liyanage  - Feature suggestion for SSHKeychain)
- Listen to local forwarded ports and start up the tunnel on demand (that's going to require some hacking with random ports to have ssh listening on)
- Give tunnels UUIDs for identification instead of using their names (<http://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFPlugIns/Tasks/GeneratingUUID.html>)

1.0 TODO:
- Comment & Clean up
- Implement Exceptions instead of NSLog
- Package

The Early Spring Code Cleanup:

- #define NSStrings is rubbish
- Constants should start uppercase
- Check retain/release
- Implement dealloc for all classes containing iVars
- Use objectEnumerator for arrays, instead of indexes
- Check for repeating code
- Move local() to a macro (http://developer.apple.com/intl/localization/tools.html)
